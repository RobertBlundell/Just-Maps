    Madame Tussauds displays a wide array of life-like wax figures of world leaders, athletes, A-list movie-stars and celebrities.

    The museum itself has an interesting origin story, being founded by Marie Tussaud who made death masks of people guillotined during the French revolution. She arrived in London in 1803 to display 30 wax figures of celebrities near Baker street, a true novelty in a time before photography existed. The London museum opened it's doors in 1835, and the madam tussauds brand now has 26 locations around the globe.
