    Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster. A British cultural icon, the tower is one of the most prominent symbols of the United Kingdom and is often in the establishing shot of films set in London.

    On 21 August 2017, the tower began a four-year period of renovation. With a few exceptions, the tower's renowned bells will be silent until the renovation is complete.

    The House of Commons is where Members of Parliament meet to discuss and propose new legislation, as well as question the prime minister. The house of lords is occupied by citizens who have distinguished themselves through their career and were subsequently appointed by the queen of England. In olden times membership was hereditary but there remain ony 92 citizens who were born into their position as of today.

    Westminster Abbey is the United Kingdom's most notable religious building and the traditional place of coronation for British monarchs for soon to be a thousand years.

    This church is the best example of early English Gothic architecthure, and it's status is not of a cathedral but instead of "Royal Peculiar" ‚Äî which implies that it is under direct sovereignty of the crown.

    Trafalgar Square was built to commemorate the Battle of Trafalgar, a British naval victory in the Napoleonic Wars with France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of Cape Trafalgar, Spain.

    At it's center lies a 52 metre tall pillar crowned with a statue of Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson and guarded by four lion statues. During the battle Admiral Nelson engaged with 27 ships against a larger coalition of thirty three French and Spanish ships. His use of unorthodox tactics payed off, and the Royal Navy sunk twenty two ships without losing a single of their own. Nelson perished shortly thereafter from wounds suffered during the battle, becoming one of Britain's greatest war heroes.

    The Fourth Plinth, left empty in 1840, is currently host to contemporary art. The square is often used for community gatherings and political demonstrations, including New Year's Eve, anti-war protests and campaigns against climate change.

    Tower Bridge is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London built between 1886 and 1894. The bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and has become an iconic symbol of London, resulting in it sometimes being confused with London Bridge, situated some 0.5 mi (0.80 km) upstream. Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges now owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. It is the only one of the Trust's bridges not to connect the City of London directly to the Southwark bank, as its northern landfall is in Tower Hamlets.

    The 'Tower' of London is in fact a castle, officially 'Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London'. The tower is at the heart of London's past, itself having a fascinating albeit bleak history.

    It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England. The White Tower was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite.

    North of the white tower are the crown jewels, which include lavishly bejeweled scepters, orbs and various crowns. The centerpiece is the Imperial State Crown: set with 2,868 diamonds including the 317-carat 'star of Africa', sapphires, emeralds, rubies and pearls. Its estimated worth is over ¬£20 Billion.

    Southwark has been a place of Christian worship for more than 1,000 years, but it's creation is a subject of debate and legend. Some accounts claim that a nunnery was established on the spot in 606 AD, but other accounts claim that a monastery was founded thee by Saint Swithun in the 9th century.

    The present building retains the basic form of the Gothic structure built between 1220 and 1420, although the nave is a late 19th-century reconstruction.

    Known locally as the Walkie-Talkie, the 38-storey building is the sixth tallest completed building in the City of London. Designed by architect Rafael Vi√±oly and costing over ¬£200 million, 20 Fenchurch Street features a highly distinctive top-heavy form which appears to burst upward and outward.

    It was discovered soon after construction that when sun shines directly onto the building, it acts as a concave mirror and focuses light onto the streets to the south. Temperature readings rose up to 91 ¬∞C, and the scorching sunlight melted cars and set fire to a local shops' carpet. A reporter for the newspaper City A.M. was even able to fry an egg in a pan set out on the ground, which earned the building it's nickname of 'Fryscraper'.
